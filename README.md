# Academic Research Paper Assistant

This repository contains the code for the **Academic Research Paper Assistant**, a Streamlit-based application that aids users in academic research by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Neo4j for paper storage and retrieval. The application allows users to search for research papers, summarize content, and answer questions about selected papers, helping users explore research topics effectively.

## Problem Statement

The application provides an end-to-end solution for:

- **Searching** academic papers on a given topic.
- **Summarizing** research contributions from selected papers.
- **Answering** specific questions regarding the papers.
- **Generating future research ideas** based on the reviewed papers.

## Key Features

1. **Search Agent**: Fetches research papers on a user-specified topic from arXiv, saving them locally for processing.
2. **Database Agent**: Manages storage of papers in a Neo4j graph database and allows querying based on criteria like year or topic.
3. **Q&A Agent**: Answers user questions related to the research papers using a question-answering model.
4. **Summarization**: Summarizes the content of selected papers using a transformer model, allowing users to quickly grasp key insights.

## Application Workflow

1. **User Input**: Users input a research topic and time range in the Streamlit sidebar.
2. **Search Papers**: The application retrieves relevant papers from arXiv based on the search criteria and stores them locally and in the Neo4j database.
3. **Select Papers**: Users can view the search results and select papers of interest.
4. **Ask Questions**: After selecting papers, users can ask questions about the papers' content, with responses generated by the Q&A model.
5. **Summarize Content**: Users can view summaries of the papers to understand core contributions and advancements.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for user interaction and UI.
- **Backend**:
  - **Neo4j** for graph-based storage of research papers.
  - **Transformers** library from Hugging Face for question answering and summarization tasks.
- **Data Handling**:
  - **PyPDF2** for extracting text from PDFs.
  - **Pydantic** for data validation.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main application script with Streamlit interface for paper search and Q&A.
- `agents.py`: Contains `SearchAgent`, `QueryAgent`, and `Database` classes for handling search, question-answering, and database operations.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies required to run the application.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://git@github.com:omm-prakash/attentions.ai-IIT-BHU-Assignment.git
   cd attentions.ai-IIT-BHU-Assignment
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install all required libraries using `requirements.txt`.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure Neo4j**:
   Ensure you have a Neo4j instance running and update the credentials in the code (`Database` class) with your Neo4j `uri`, `username`, and `password`.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```
2. **Search for Papers**:

   - Enter a research topic and specify a publication year range.
   - Click "Search Papers" to retrieve and display relevant papers.
3. **Select and Query Papers**:

   - Select papers to include for querying.
   - Enter questions related to the content of selected papers to receive answers from the model.
4. **Summarize Papers**:

   - Summaries for selected papers are generated using the summarization model, providing concise overviews of their contributions.

## Future Work

The application can be extended with:

- **Image and Table Analysis**: Answer questions about images, charts, or tables within the papers.
- **Future Research Suggestions**: Generate ideas for future research based on analyzed papers.

## Dependencies

Key libraries include:

- `streamlit`
- `transformers`
- `neo4j`
- `arxiv`
- `pydantic`
- `PyPDF2`

For a complete list, see `requirements.txt`.
